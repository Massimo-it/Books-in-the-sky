# Books-in-the-sky

A WEB application to invite you to read more books :)

It works with the openlibrary.org API, you write a topic and the APP shows you the TITLE and the AUTHOR of the first 20 books about that topic. Then you can choose one of the books listed and read its description.

The program is written in HTML/CSS and JavaSscript. The API request uses the AXIOS technology.
